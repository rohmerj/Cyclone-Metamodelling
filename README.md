This is the jupyter notebook for using R package [kergp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kergp/index.html) to handle categorical input variables in Gaussian Process Regression models. The application case is based on [Rohmer et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-016-2513-8) within the ANR-funded project (ANR – 14 – CE03 – 0013) [SPICY](http://spicy.brgm.fr/fr).

 *kergp* was developed within the frame of the Chair in Applied Mathematics OQUAIDO, gathering partners in technological research (BRGM, CEA, IFPEN, IRSN, Safran, Storengy) and academia (CNRS, Ecole Centrale de Lyon, Mines Saint-Etienne, University of Grenoble, University of Nice, University of Toulouse) around advanced methods for Computer Experiments.
